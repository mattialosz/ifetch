## Overview
**iFetch** is a lightweight and animated system fetch tool for macOS, implemented in C++. It's similar to `neofetch`, but with an elegant Apple-inspired ASCII logo and animated color bars. It provides detailed system information, including CPU, RAM, GPU, OS version, uptime, and more. There's a static and dynamic version.

```bash
./ifetch
```

### 2. Global Installation (Recommended)
To make `iFetch` available as a system-wide command, move it to `/usr/local/bin/`:
```bash
sudo mv ifetch /usr/local/bin/
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/ifetch
```
Now, you can run `iFetch` from anywhere by typing:
```bash
ifetch
```

## Usage
Simply open a terminal and run:
```bash
ifetch
```
Press `[ESC]` or `q` to exit the animated display.
